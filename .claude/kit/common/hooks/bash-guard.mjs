// bash-guard — the harness tier of the gate layer, for shell commands.
//
// rules/agent/autonomy.md says in prose what an agent must never do: bypass a
// hook, disable the gate layer, forge the review report. Prose persuades; this
// file does not. It is the second of TWO tiers, and it is the weaker one:
//
//   1. git (lefthook) — portable across every agent, the universal floor. It
//      catches what git can see: a commit on the trunk, an unanswered CRITICAL.
//   2. harness (this) — catches what git CANNOT see, because it never gets that
//      far: the `--no-verify`, the `lefthook uninstall`, the `rm` on the report.
//
// Neither tier makes drift impossible. They make it expensive and LOUD. The
// impossibility lives on the server (branch protection) and in the orchestrator.
// See ./README.md — do not sell this as more than it is.
//
// Two verdicts, on purpose:
//   • DENY (exit 2) — the command has no legitimate form. stderr comes back to
//     the agent as the reason, so it can fix the cause instead of the gate.
//   • ASK (json)    — the command WRITES to the gate layer itself. Sometimes
//     that is the task (`/ci-setup` edits a workflow), so a human decides.
//     Headless, "ask" blocks — which is the intended answer for an unattended run.
//
// Hosts: Claude Code (PreToolUse, matcher "Bash") and Cursor
// (beforeShellExecution). One script, two payload dialects — see ask().
//
// It FAILS OPEN. A crash here must not brick a session, so an unreadable payload
// is reported on stderr and the command proceeds. A guard is a cost multiplier,
// never a proof.
